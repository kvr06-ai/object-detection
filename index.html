                <h2>Introduction: The Quest for Computer Vision</h2>
                <p>How did we go from computers that couldn't tell cats from cars to systems that can identify dozens of objects in milliseconds?</p>
                <p>For decades, enabling computers to "see" and understand visual data has been one of the most challenging problems in artificial intelligence. The ability to detect and locate objects within images is a fundamental task that unlocks countless applications - from autonomous vehicles and medical imaging to surveillance systems and augmented reality experiences.</p>
                <p>This capability, known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_detection" target="_blank">object detection</a>, has undergone a remarkable transformation in the past two decades. The journey from rudimentary algorithms that relied on hand-engineered features to today's sophisticated neural architectures represents one of the most striking success stories in modern computer science.</p>
                <p>In this interactive exploration, we'll visualize how object detection has evolved from handcrafted features to end-to-end neural architectures, with interactive demonstrations at each step. By understanding this evolution, we can better appreciate the technical breakthroughs that have made computer vision one of the most rapidly advancing fields in technology today.</p>

                <h2>The Foundation: Traditional Computer Vision Approaches</h2>
                
                <h3>Viola-Jones: The First Real-Time Object Detector</h3>
                <p>In 2001, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viola%E2%80%93Jones_object_detection_framework" target="_blank">Paul Viola and Michael Jones</a> introduced a groundbreaking algorithm that, for the first time, made real-time face detection possible on consumer hardware. Their approach combined three key innovations: Haar-like features, the AdaBoost learning algorithm, and a cascade structure that allowed for efficient computation.</p>
                
                <p>Haar-like features are simple rectangular filters that detect basic visual patterns like edges, lines, and center-surround features. These features are computed using integral images, which allow for constant-time feature computation regardless of filter size - a critical optimization that made real-time performance possible.</p>
                
                <figure>
                    <img src="img/haar_features.png" alt="Haar features used in Viola-Jones detection" width="500">
                    <figcaption>Haar-like features detect simple visual patterns like edges, lines, and center-surround differences. Image source: Wikipedia</figcaption>
                </figure>
                
                <p>The cascade classifier architecture was perhaps the most innovative aspect of their work. By arranging classifiers in stages of increasing complexity, most non-face regions could be quickly rejected in early stages, focusing computational resources on promising regions. This "attentional cascade" approach reduced computation time dramatically while maintaining accuracy.</p>
                
                <h3>HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) + SVM</h3>
                <p>In 2005, Navneet Dalal and Bill Triggs introduced the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram_of_oriented_gradients" target="_blank">Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)</a> feature descriptor, which significantly improved object detection accuracy, particularly for pedestrian detection. HOG captures the distribution of gradient directions in localized portions of an image, creating a representation that is invariant to small geometric and photometric transformations.</p>

                    <p class="explanation">The HOG descriptor divides the image into small cells, computes a histogram of gradient orientations for each cell, and normalizes these histograms within larger blocks. This creates a feature vector that is fed into a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier.</p>
                </div>
                
                <p>HOG features paired with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine" target="_blank">Support Vector Machines (SVMs)</a> became the standard approach for object detection until the deep learning revolution. The technique works by:</p>
                
                <ol>
                    <li>Computing gradients throughout the image</li>
                    <li>Dividing the image into cells and creating histograms of gradient orientations for each cell</li>
                    <li>Normalizing these histograms within overlapping blocks to improve invariance to lighting changes</li>
                    <li>Concatenating these features into a vector</li>
                    <li>Training an SVM classifier on these feature vectors</li>
                </ol>
                
                <h3>DPM (Deformable Parts Models)</h3>
                <p>Pedro Felzenszwalb and colleagues introduced <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deformable_parts_models" target="_blank">Deformable Parts Models (DPM)</a> in 2008, extending HOG by modeling objects as collections of parts arranged in a deformable configuration. DPM addressed one of HOG's major limitations: the inability to handle significant variations in object appearance and pose.</p>
                
                <figure id="dpm-visualization">
                    <!-- The DPM visualization will be rendered here by JavaScript -->
                    <figcaption>DPM models objects as a root filter plus deformable part filters, allowing it to handle variations in object pose and appearance. The root filter captures the overall shape while part filters handle detailed components with deformation costs for flexibility.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                
                <p>DPM works by defining a "root" filter for the entire object and smaller part filters that can move relative to the root. Each part has an anchor position and a deformation cost for moving away from that position. During detection, the algorithm finds the optimal placement of all parts to maximize the overall score.</p>
                
                <p>While DPM represented the pinnacle of traditional computer vision approaches to object detection, it was computationally expensive, with detection times measured in seconds per image. As deep learning emerged, these traditional approaches would soon be surpassed in both accuracy and speed.</p>

                <h2>The CNN Revolution: R-CNN Family</h2>
                
                <h3>R-CNN: Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks</h3>
                <p>In 2014, Ross Girshick and colleagues introduced <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.2524" target="_blank">R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks)</a>, marking a paradigm shift in object detection. Instead of using hand-engineered features like HOG, R-CNN leveraged the power of deep learning to automatically learn hierarchical feature representations from data.</p>
                
                <p>The R-CNN workflow consists of three main steps:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Region Proposal Generation:</strong> Using the Selective Search algorithm to generate approximately 2,000 category-independent region proposals per image</li>
                    <li><strong>Feature Extraction:</strong> Running each proposed region through a pre-trained CNN to extract a fixed-length feature vector</li>
                    <li><strong>Classification:</strong> Classifying each region using class-specific linear SVMs and refining the bounding box coordinates</li>
                </ol>
                
                <figure id="rcnn-architecture">
                    <!-- The R-CNN architecture visualization will be rendered here by JavaScript -->
                    <figcaption>R-CNN architecture: Region proposals from Selective Search are processed by a CNN, then classified by SVMs.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                
                <p>R-CNN achieved a remarkable 30% relative improvement over the previous state-of-the-art DPM on the PASCAL VOC detection benchmark. However, it had significant limitations:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Training was multi-stage and computationally expensive</li>
                    <li>Detection was slow (47 seconds per image) because each region proposal required a separate forward pass through the CNN</li>
                    <li>The Selective Search algorithm was a bottleneck and not learnable</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Fast R-CNN: Streamlining Detection</h3>
                <p>To address these limitations, Girshick introduced <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.08083" target="_blank">Fast R-CNN</a> in 2015. The key insight was to process the entire image once through the CNN, and then extract features for each region proposal from the resulting feature map using a technique called RoI (Region of Interest) pooling.</p>

                <p>Fast R-CNN offered several advantages over the original R-CNN:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Training was single-stage and 9x faster</li>
                    <li>Detection was 213x faster (0.3 seconds per image vs. 47 seconds)</li>
                    <li>Higher mean Average Precision (mAP) on benchmark datasets</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>However, Fast R-CNN still relied on the external Selective Search algorithm for region proposals, which remained a computational bottleneck.</p>
                
                <h3>Faster R-CNN: End-to-End Detection</h3>
                <p>In late 2015, Shaoqing Ren and colleagues introduced <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01497" target="_blank">Faster R-CNN</a>, which integrated region proposal generation into the network itself with a Region Proposal Network (RPN). This created the first truly end-to-end trainable object detection system.</p>

                <h2>Single-Shot Detectors: Trading Accuracy for Speed</h2>
                
                <h3>SSD: Single Shot MultiBox Detector</h3>
                <p>While the R-CNN family provided high accuracy, their two-stage approach limited real-time applications. In 2016, Wei Liu and colleagues introduced <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02325" target="_blank">SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector)</a>, which eliminated the separate region proposal stage by directly predicting bounding boxes and class probabilities from feature maps in a single forward pass.</p>
                
                <p>SSD uses multiple feature maps at different scales to detect objects of various sizes. Early feature maps (with higher resolution) are responsible for detecting smaller objects, while deeper feature maps detect larger objects. At each feature map location, SSD predicts offsets to default boxes (similar to anchor boxes) and class probabilities.</p>
                
                <figure id="ssd-architecture">

                    <figcaption>SSD predicts detections at multiple scales from different feature maps in the network.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                
                <p>SSD achieved comparable accuracy to Faster R-CNN while being 3-5x faster, enabling real-time object detection at 45-59 frames per second on a high-end GPU.</p>
                
                <h3>YOLO: You Only Look Once</h3>
                <p>Also in 2016, Joseph Redmon and colleagues introduced <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02640" target="_blank">YOLO (You Only Look Once)</a>, which took a different approach to single-shot detection. YOLO divides the image into a grid and predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from grid cells, treating detection as a regression problem.</p>
                
                <p>The original YOLO architecture was simpler than SSD, using a single feature map to make predictions. Each grid cell predicts a fixed number of bounding boxes, each with a confidence score and class probabilities. This unified approach was extremely fast, achieving 45 frames per second on a high-end GPU.</p>

                <p>Feature Pyramid Networks (FPN) were introduced by Lin et al. in 2017. They address the challenge of detecting objects at multiple scales in a single forward pass.

                <h2>Transformers Enter Computer Vision: DETR and Beyond</h2>
                
                <h3>DETR: End-to-End Object Detection with Transformers</h3>
                <p>In 2020, Facebook AI Research introduced <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.12872" target="_blank">DETR (DEtection TRansformer)</a>, which represented a radical departure from previous object detection approaches. DETR leverages the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(machine_learning_model)" target="_blank">Transformer architecture</a>, originally designed for natural language processing tasks, and applies it to object detection.</p>
                
                <p>DETR eliminates many of the hand-designed components in previous detection systems, such as anchor boxes and non-maximum suppression, replacing them with a simple, end-to-end approach:</p>
                
                <ol>
                    <li>A CNN backbone extracts features from the input image</li>
                    <li>A Transformer encoder-decoder processes these features</li>
                    <li>A set of learned object queries interact with the encoded image through self-attention</li>
                    <li>The decoder outputs a fixed set of predictions (e.g., 100 objects) directly</li>
                    <li>A bipartite matching loss assigns predictions to ground truth objects, encouraging one-to-one matching</li>
                </ol>
                
                <figure>
                    <img src="https://production-media.paperswithcode.com/methods/Screen_Shot_2020-06-23_at_4.49.40_PM_c7jyRxJ.png" alt="DETR architecture" width="600">

                </figure>
                
                <p>The key innovation in DETR is treating object detection as a direct set prediction problem. Unlike previous approaches that predict a large number of candidate boxes and then filter them, DETR directly predicts a fixed set of objects with no duplicate detections. This is achieved through the bipartite matching loss, which finds the optimal one-to-one assignment between predictions and ground truth objects.</p>

                <h3>Deformable DETR and Efficient Variants</h3>
                <p>While DETR achieved comparable performance to Faster R-CNN, it had some limitations, particularly slow convergence during training and difficulties with small objects. To address these issues, researchers developed several improved variants:</p>
